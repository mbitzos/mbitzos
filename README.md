# Hey

I'm Michael, welcome to my GitHub account! 
<br><br/>
You'll notice that I primarily work on private repositories. <br/>Those are games/game-related projects that I work on with my team [Overlook Studios](https://overlook-studios.com).
<br><br/>
I like to work on front-end projects using Vue.js at work and sometimes on the side, <br/> but right now I am mainly working on games in Unity with C#.
<br><br/>
Visit my [personal website](http://michaelbitzos.com) if you wanna see my resume/contact info.
